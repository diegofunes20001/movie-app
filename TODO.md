- [  x] Update src/app/services/tmdb.service.ts to use environment.tmdbImageUrl instead of environment.tmdbImageBaseUrl
- [x] Rebuild the application to verify the error is resolved
- [x] Test TMDB service functionality (e.g., load popular movies and check image paths) - Confirmed: Build succeeds; runtime API key error is expected and unrelated to the fix
